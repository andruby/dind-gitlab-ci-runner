# GitlabCI runner with Docker-in-Docker

This uses [sameersbn/docker-gitlab-ci-runner](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab-ci-runner)
as a base image, and adds the Docker-in-Docker functionality from [jpetazzo/dind](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind).

From usage see [sameersbn/docker-gitlab-ci-runner](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab-ci-runner).

With this image you can run docker for your tests.
